import ToolboxMdxWrapper from "../../../../toolbox/src/demo/ui/ToolboxMdxWrapper.tsx"
import UpgradeProxy from "../../../../toolbox/src/demo/examples/ValidatorManager/UpgradeProxy.tsx"

Now that the `ValidatorManager` contract has been deployed, we can upgrade the proxy that is registered on the P-Chain as the `ValidatorManager` contract to point to the actual `ValidatorManager` implementation.


<ToolboxMdxWrapper>
    <UpgradeProxy />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>
