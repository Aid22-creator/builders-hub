## Proof of Authority

Proof of Authority for an Avalanche L1 is controlled by the `ValidatorManager` contract.

The controller of the `ValidatorManager` contract is the `admin` address. Only the `admin` address can add, remove, and update weights from the validator set.

Because the `ValidatorManager` is a Solidity contract, any type of address can be set as the `admin` address. This means that the `admin` address can be a multisig address, a timelock address, or a simple externally owned account (EOA).

    `ValidatorManager` can later be converted to Proof of Stake by transferring the ownership to a `StakingManager` contract.
</Callout>

The `ValidatorManager` inherits from Open Zeppelin's `OwnableUpgradeable` contract, so the `admin` address can be changed by the current owner using the `transferOwnership` function.

The P-Chain will accept signed warp messages emitted by the `ValidatorManager` contract.
