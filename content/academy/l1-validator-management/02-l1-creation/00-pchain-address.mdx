### P-Chain Address Format
The P-Chain uses [Bech32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32) addresses, which follow the BIP-0173 standard. 

These addresses consist of:
- A Human-Readable Part (HRP) - "avax" for mainnet or "fuji" for testnet
- The separator "1" 
- A base32-encoded address
- A 6-character error correction code

For example: `P-avax1kj06lhgx84h39snsljcey3tpc046ze68mek3g5`

This differs from C-Chain addresses which use the Ethereum hex format (starting with 0x). While both P-Chain and X-Chain use Bech32, they are distinguished by their chain prefix (P- vs X-).
