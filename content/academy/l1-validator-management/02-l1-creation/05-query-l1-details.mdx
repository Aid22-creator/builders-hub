### Query the L1 Details

To query the L1 details, you can simply use the [Glacier API from AvaCloud](https://developers.avacloud.io/data-api/primary-network/get-subnet-details-by-id).

Enter your `subnetID` and network name (e.g. `mainnet` or `fuji`) and you will receive the L1 details.

It should display the L1 details similar to the following:

```json 
{
  "createBlockTimestamp": 123,
  "createBlockIndex": "<string>",
  "subnetId": "<string>",
  "ownerAddresses": [
    "<string>"
  ],
  "threshold": 123,
  "locktime": 123,
  "subnetOwnershipInfo": {
    "locktime": 0,
    "threshold": 1,
    "addresses": [
      "avax1qm2a25eytsrj235hxg6jc0mwk99tss64eqevsw"
    ]
  },
  "isL1": true,
  "l1ConversionTransactionHash": "<string>",
  "l1ValidatorManagerDetails": {
    "blockchainId": "<string>",
    "contractAddress": "<string>"
  },
  "blockchains": [
    {
      "blockchainId": "<string>"
    }
  ]
}
```

We mainly care that the `isL1` field is `true` and that the `l1ValidatorManagerDetails` field is not empty.
