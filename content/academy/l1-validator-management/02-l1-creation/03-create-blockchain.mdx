### Creating a Blockchain
Now that you have created a `subnet`, and created a `genesis.json` file, you can create a blockchain.

The `CreateChainTx` transaction establishes a new blockchain on the P-Chain, associating it with your previously created `subnetID`.

During this process, the transaction uploads your `genesis.json` configuration to the P-Chain and generates a unique `blockchainID` that will permanently identify your chain on the network.


The `VM ID` field is the VM ID for the blockchain. When you build default `subnet-evm` chains, the VM ID is `srEXiWaHuhNyGwPUi444Tu47ZEDwxTWrbQiuD7FmgSAQ6X7Dy`.
If you are using a custom VM (e.g. `subnet-evm` with custom precompiles, or `hypersdk`), you will want to change this field to the correct VM ID.

    <CreateChain />

Once the transaction is confirmed, you will have a new blockchain on the P-Chain.

You can quickly start an `avalanchego` node in Docker and connect it to your chain using the [L1 Toolbox](https://build.avax.network/tools/l1-toolbox#avalanchegoDocker)

If you want a more hands on approach, you can read the [Node & Validator](/docs/nodes) documentation.
