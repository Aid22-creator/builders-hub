import ToolboxMdxWrapper from "../../../../toolbox/src/demo/ui/ToolboxMdxWrapper"
import ConvertToL1 from "../../../../toolbox/src/demo/examples/L1/ConvertToL1.tsx"

Now we will convert the subnet to an L1. 

Notice the input fields for validator information. This will be the "genesis" validators for the L1.

This is the initial validator set for the L1. They will always be treated as Proof of Authority (PoA) validators, but can be removed and added later for Proof of Stake (PoS) validators.

    <ConvertToL1 />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

Now that you have created a blockchain, you can convert the subnet to an L1.

This transaction converts the subnet to an L1.
