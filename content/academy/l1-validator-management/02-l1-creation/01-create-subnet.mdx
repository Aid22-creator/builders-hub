### Process of Creating a Subnet
Now that you have connected your wallet to the P-Chain, you can create a subnet.

The first step is to issue a `CreateSubnetTx` transaction on the P-Chain. This transaction hashes your wallet address and creates a `subnetID` with that hash.

We will use this `subnetID` later on to create our blockchain and add validators to it.

You can create as many subnets as you want using the same wallet.
