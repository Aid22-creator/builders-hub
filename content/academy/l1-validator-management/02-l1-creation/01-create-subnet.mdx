import ToolboxMdxWrapper from "../../../../toolbox/src/demo/ui/ToolboxMdxWrapper"
import CreateSubnet from "../../../../toolbox/src/demo/examples/L1/CreateSubnet.tsx"

<ToolboxMdxWrapper>
    <CreateSubnet />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

Now that you have connected your wallet to the P-Chain, you can create a subnet.

This transaction simply hashes your wallet address and creates a subnet with that hash.

You can create as many subnets as you want.
