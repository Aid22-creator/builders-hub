import ToolboxMdxWrapper from "../../../../toolbox/src/demo/ui/ToolboxMdxWrapper.tsx"
import UpgradeProxy from "../../../../toolbox/src/demo/examples/ValidatorManager/UpgradeProxy.tsx"

Now that the `ValidatorManager` contract has been deployed, we can upgrade the proxy that is registered on the P-Chain as the `ValidatorManager` contract to point to the actual `ValidatorManager` implementation.

<Callout type="info">
    If you used the Genesis Builder from this course to create your L1, the `Manager Address` placeholder is a Open Zeppelin [TransparentUpgradeableProxy](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy) contract included in the `genesis.json` file as pre-deployed bytecode.
